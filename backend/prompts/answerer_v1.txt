Answer the user question with a strictly valid JSON object using the schema:
{
  "summary_points": [
    {"id":"p1","text":"one-sentence point","confidence":"high|medium|low"}
  ],
  "detailed_explanation": "1-3 paragraphs",
  "evidence": ["url or citation", "..."],
  "reproducible_example": "(code/steps or '')"
}

Rules:
- Do not include any text outside the JSON.
- Provide 3-6 concise summary_points.
- If unsure, set confidence to "low" and explain the uncertainty in detailed_explanation.
- Do not invent facts; prefer to say "insufficient evidence".
- Keep JSON minimal; no trailing comments.

Placeholders to substitute before calling the model:
- <USER_QUESTION>
- <CONTEXT_HISTORY>

User question:
<USER_QUESTION>

Relevant context (may be empty):
<CONTEXT_HISTORY>
